# BlazorProject

This is a school project in Blazor. The project consisted in the realization of the "Inventaire" page.

There is a second branch named inventory left which contains the inventory. It doesn't work, that's why it's not merged. On the other hand, the code allowing its normal operation is well implemented. On the master branch, is the list of items that works correctly. There is a small display problem and you have to interact with the search bar or the button located on the left side of this bar to see it appear. The search works correctly.

To search a certain item, you can enter the name of it. If any item apears at the begining, go to the input text box of click the search button.
